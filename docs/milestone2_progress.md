# M2 Progress

## Assigned tasks for Milestone 2
For Milestone 2, we are splitting up into pairs to work on each module. The pairs for each module are as follows:

 - AD_Object (base var class)
   - Kaiwen
   - Ninon
 - BasicMath (elementary functions)
   - Nicole
   - Zachary
  
 For documentation and testing, we all expect to be involved and will write and test as we code. We expect to work on future features proposal together as well, both for the brainstorming and the write-up.
 - Documentation
   - Each person writes while developing.
 - Testing
   - Using test driven development in our pairs, we will share our test writing duties.
 -Future Features

## What each group member has done since submission of Milestone 1
 - Zach:
   - Pyscaffold implementation 
 -Ninon:
   -I made changes to the Organization section by altering the directory structure and editing the original writing so that it was in paragraph form as requested. I also added more detailed explanations for how we would distribute the package. Finally, I added the Feedback section indicating the comments made by the Teaching Fellows and what I did to address those comments.
